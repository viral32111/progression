# Progression

This is a [Minecraft Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod that limits player progression to other dimensions until global player experience thresholds are met.

Thank you to [Toothfull](https://github.com/toothfull) for the idea.

## Usage

1. Download the mod file (`.jar`) from [the latest release](https://github.com/viral32111/progression/releases/latest).
2. Place the mod file in the server's `mods` directory.
3. Start the server to initialise the mod for the first time.
3. Configure appropriately in the `config/viral32111/progression.json` file.
4. Restart the server.
